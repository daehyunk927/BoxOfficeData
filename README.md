# Web Scrape BoxOfficeData
My objective for this project is to create a MySQL database with web-scraped Historical Movies Box Office Data. For the scope of this project, the database will be on my local system, but this can be created on the cloud server as well utilizing the same methods.

After setting up the database, I will clean the tables and pull the data. Using the extracted data, I will also perform some basic data analysis.

This project will consist of several components taught in this class such as web-scraping HTML tables, storing data in MySQL database, and cleaning and analyzing data using R packages/functions.
